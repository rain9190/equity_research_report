# equity_research_report

This project was completed as part of IFSA, IIT Kharagpur. It focuses on the equity valuation of Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd. using data-driven financial modeling techniques.

I built the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) model using data from annual reports and the Damodaran database, applying a bottom-up beta approach with regression to estimate the cost of equity. To use the regression code just change the ticker for the stock or index and then it's good to go.

Using these inputs, I developed a DCF model in Excel to forecast future cash flows. The work involved data collection, model building, validation, and interpretation of results to understand how key assumptions affect valuation.
